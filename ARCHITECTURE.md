# Architecture Specification: Cadence Clinical

## 1. System Vision & Problem Statement

Traditional clinical trial builds require manual, error-prone translation of protocol documents into downstream EDC systems. This causes multi-month setup delays, risk of discrepancies between protocols and CRFs, and expensive amendment re-work.

**Cadence Clinical** solves this by establishing a single, metadata-driven source of truth that automates the generation of downstream trial infrastructure directly from digitized protocol definitions.

## 2. Core Service Domains

### A. Designer Service (`apps/designer`)
* **Role:** Study Definition Repository (SDR) and Clinical Metadata Repository (MDR).
* **Datastore:** Neo4j Graph Database.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Protocol structure authoring (Arms, Epochs, Branches, Visits).
  * Schedule of Activities (SoA) matrix generation.
  * CDISC USDM export endpoints.
  * Fine-grained protocol semantic versioning and amendment diffing.

### B. Execution Engine (`apps/execution`)
* **Role:** Electronic Data Capture (EDC) Runtime.
* **Datastore:** PostgreSQL Relational Database.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Automatic generation of eCRF layouts and validation rules from USDM specifications.
  * Subject enrollment, matrix tracking, and event scheduling.
  * Real-time edit-check evaluation during site data entry.
  * Discrepancy (query) workflow management.

### C. Web Client (`apps/web`)
* **Role:** Primary User Interface.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Renders standard clinical forms directly from XML payloads compiled by the backend translation engine.
  * Provides site investigators and data managers a unified interface for data entry and clinical study management.

### D. Shared UI Components (`packages/ui`)
* **Role:** Design System Library.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Provides reusable, standardized UI components (e.g., inputs, layouts) ensuring design consistency.
  * Shared seamlessly across frontend packages using the pnpm workspace protocol.

### E. Clinical Metadata Validation & Translation (`apps/designer` and `apps/execution`)
* **Role:** Unified Standard Domain Modeling & Validation.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Official CDISC USDM standard representation using the `usdm` package inside the Designer (`apps/designer/`).
  * In-memory bidirectional transformation adapters (USDM JSON ↔ OpenRosa / CDISC ODM) in the Execution engine (`apps/execution/`).

### F. Gateway & Identity (`apps/gateway`)
* **Role:** Reverse Proxy & Access Control.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Keycloak OIDC JWT validation.
  * Centralized Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mapping:
    * `Study Designer` ──► Design permissions in `apps/designer`
    * `Site Investigator / CRC` ──► Data capture permissions in `apps/execution`
    * `Data Manager` ──► Query and form management across both domains.
    * `Monitor` ──► Monitoring, site verification, and CTMS operations in `apps/ctms`
    * `Grants Manager` ──► Budget, financials, and CTMS administrative operations in `apps/ctms`

### G. Event-Driven eTMF Module (`apps/etmf`)
* **Role:** Electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) Repository and Completeness Tracker.
* **Datastore:** SQLite / PostgreSQL Relational Database.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Ingests, taxonomy-classifies, and versions clinical trial artifacts mapped to DIA TMF Reference Model Zones 1-11.
  * Implements Expected Document Lists (EDLs) through the `ExpectedDocument` data model to replace static, hardcoded milestone rules.
  * Computes site-aware, data-driven milestone completeness checks by querying active EDLs and combining study-scope and site-scope required artifacts.
  * Enforces role-based access control and trial lock restrictions via the Gateway and `GatewayAuthMiddleware` to block read-only inspector roles from mutating definitions or archives.
  * Maintains a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant audit trail (`TMFAuditLog`) capturing user contexts, timestamps, and justifications for all eTMF views, downloads, EDL updates, and completeness checks.

### H. Clinical Trial Management System (`apps/ctms`)
* **Role:** Administrative, Financial, Operational, and Monitoring Workspace.
* **Datastore:** SQLite / PostgreSQL Relational Database.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Trial, site, and operational metadata tracking (recruitment, milestone verification).
  * Budget and investigator grant tracking across roles like Grants Manager.
  * Integration with Keycloak OIDC authentication via the secure API gateway.
  * Full 21 CFR Part 11 compliant auditing (`CTMSAuditLog`) recording all actions, view queries, and mutations with explicit change reasons.
  * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensuring write mutations are restricted to roles like `Monitor`, `Grants Manager`, `CRA`, or `Admin`, and read-only queries are restricted to authorized operational personnel.

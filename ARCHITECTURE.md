# Architecture Specification: Cadence Clinical

## 1. System Vision & Problem Statement

Traditional clinical trial builds require manual, error-prone translation of protocol documents into downstream EDC systems. This causes multi-month setup delays, risk of discrepancies between protocols and CRFs, and expensive amendment re-work.

**Cadence Clinical** solves this by establishing a single, metadata-driven source of truth that automates the generation of downstream trial infrastructure directly from digitized protocol definitions.

## 2. Core Service Domains

### A. Designer Service (`apps/designer`)
* **Role:** Study Definition Repository (SDR) and Clinical Metadata Repository (MDR).
* **Datastore:** Neo4j Graph Database.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Protocol structure authoring (Arms, Epochs, Branches, Visits).
  * Schedule of Activities (SoA) matrix generation.
  * CDISC USDM export endpoints.
  * Fine-grained protocol semantic versioning and amendment diffing.

### B. Execution Engine (`apps/execution`)
* **Role:** Electronic Data Capture (EDC) Runtime.
* **Datastore:** PostgreSQL Relational Database.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Automatic generation of eCRF layouts and validation rules from USDM specifications.
  * Subject enrollment, matrix tracking, and event scheduling.
  * Real-time edit-check evaluation during site data entry.
  * Discrepancy (query) workflow management.

### C. Web Client (`apps/web`)
* **Role:** Primary User Interface.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Renders standard clinical forms directly from XML payloads compiled by the backend translation engine.
  * Provides site investigators and data managers a unified interface for data entry and clinical study management.

### D. Shared UI Components (`packages/ui`)
* **Role:** Design System Library.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Provides reusable, standardized UI components (e.g., inputs, layouts) ensuring design consistency.
  * Shared seamlessly across frontend packages using the pnpm workspace protocol.

### E. Clinical Metadata Validation & Translation (`apps/designer` and `apps/execution`)
* **Role:** Unified Standard Domain Modeling & Validation.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Official CDISC USDM standard representation using the `usdm` package inside the Designer (`apps/designer/`).
  * In-memory bidirectional transformation adapters (USDM JSON ↔ OpenRosa / CDISC ODM) in the Execution engine (`apps/execution/`).

### F. Gateway & Identity (`apps/gateway`)
* **Role:** Reverse Proxy & Access Control.
* **Core Responsibilities:**
  * Keycloak OIDC JWT validation.
  * Centralized Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mapping:
    * `Study Designer` ──► Design permissions in `apps/designer`
    * `Site Investigator / CRC` ──► Data capture permissions in `apps/execution`
    * `Data Manager` ──► Query and form management across both domains.

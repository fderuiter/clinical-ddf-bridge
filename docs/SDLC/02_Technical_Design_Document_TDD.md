## 1. Executive Summary & Regulatory Alignment

### 1.1 Executive Summary
The Cadence Clinical Platform is a unified, standalone eClinical system that synthesizes upstream Clinical Metadata Management (MDR) with downstream Electronic Data Capture (EDC) into an automated, single-source Digital Data Flow (DDF). This document serves as the master Technical Design Document (TDD) and architectural specification for the platform. It details the modular monolith boundaries, core database schematics, graph-based metadata versioning and immutability engine, custom XForm expression execution trees, and robust offline synchronization algorithms.

By implementing strict decoupling between the study configuration state (housed in Neo4j) and subject clinical transactions (housed in PostgreSQL), Cadence Clinical solves the industry-wide challenge of dynamic clinical protocol updates without risking transactional database corruption or disrupting ongoing patient visits.

### 1.2 Standards Mapping: IEC 62304 (Software Life Cycle Processes)
Under the IEC 62304 standard, Cadence Clinical is classified as **Class C (potential for serious injury or death)** due to its active role in clinical decision-making systems, unblinding mechanisms, and patient randomization algorithms.

Every design decision in this specification maps directly to the required development processes of IEC 62304:
* **Section 5.3 (Software Architectural Design):** Fully realized via the microservice boundaries, service topologies, and interface definitions outlined in Section 2.
* **Section 5.4 (Software Detailed Design):** Documented through precise database schematics (DDL), Neo4j property schemas, AST parse tree structures, and sync conflict resolution pseudo-code in Sections 3, 4, and 5.
* **Section 5.5 (Software Unit Testing & Integration):** Traced to automated test suites that enforce the software boundaries, database rollback states, and schema migration protocols.

### 1.3 Standards Mapping: ISO 14971 (Risk Management for Software Hazards)
Clinical systems present complex operational hazards. Data loss, blinding breaches, or invalid randomization can corrupt entire multi-million dollar trials or endanger patients.

This architecture implements a strict risk-control hierarchy following ISO 14971 principles:
1. **Inherent Safety by Design:** Utilizes Neo4j graph schemas to enforce study metadata immutability natively, preventing accidental or malicious changes to active study protocols.
2. **Protective Measures in the Software:** Employs database-level triggers to catch out-of-band updates, writing any schema bypass attempts into a secure, isolated shadow schema.
3. **Information for Safety (Alerting & Monitoring):** Integrates cryptographic ledger checking to flag ledger anomalies or data tampering instantly, initiating automated system-wide quarantines and alert escalations.

### 1.4 Regulatory Frameworks: 21 CFR Part 11 & EU Annex 11
Compliance with electronic record standards is built directly into the database engine. Every table schema inherits the platform's universal GxP audit fields:
* `created_at`: High-precision UTC timestamp.
* `created_by`: Deterministic user identity (OIDC Subject UUID).
* `reason_for_change`: A mandatory string detailing the business/clinical justification for the action.
* `version_index`: An auto-incrementing integer providing a strict temporal sequence of records.

## 2. Global System Architecture & Infrastructure

### 2.1 Multi-Zone Kubernetes Topology & Secure Blueprint
Cadence Clinical is deployed on a highly secure, resilient, multi-Availability Zone (Multi-AZ) Kubernetes (EKS) infrastructure. The design is structured to satisfy the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 security controls, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and absolute availability.

```

### 2.2 Microservices & Modular Boundaries
The application is structured as a modular monolith with strict boundary controls, ensuring that services communicate only over defined REST endpoints, secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) propagated via Keycloak.

#### 2.2.1 Gateway Service (`apps/gateway`)
The Gateway serves as the single entry point. It handles:
* **SSL/TLS Termination:** Enforces TLS 1.3 with secure cipher suites.
* **Authentication Verification:** Integrates with Keycloak OIDC. Validates JWT signature, expiration, and scope.
* **Rate Limiting:** Utilizes an in-memory Redis token bucket algorithm limiting endpoints based on IP and user profile.
* **Audit Logs:** Intercepts and logs all REST mutation requests to the central compliance ledger prior to routing.

#### 2.2.2 Designer Service (`apps/designer`)
The Designer Service manages clinical metadata (MDR) and study definitions. It interacts exclusively with Neo4j.
* **Responsibility:** Structural configuration of studies, arm creation, visits, eCRF templates, biomedical concepts, and value-level metadata (VLM).
* **Data Guarantee:** All output is CDISC USDM (v3.0/v4.0) compliant.
* **Storage:** Neo4j Community/Enterprise Edition. Communicates over the Bolt protocol.

#### 2.2.3 Execution Service (`apps/execution`)
The Execution Service manages subject data capture (EDC) and clinical transactions. It interacts exclusively with PostgreSQL.
* **Responsibility:** Subject state transitions, eCRF instance entries, query lifecycles, and randomization allocation.
* **Data Guarantee:** Compiles to CDISC ODM XML/JSON outputs.
* **Storage:** PostgreSQL. Communicates via SQLModel / SQLAlchemy async connections.

### 2.3 Distributed Caching Layer
Redis is deployed as a highly-available clustered setup in the isolated subnet tier. Its primary functions include:
1. **Dynamic Rate-Limiting:** Tracks IP requests using a sliding-window counter.
2. **OIDC Certificate Caching:** Stores Keycloak's public keys (JWKS) to avoid calling the Keycloak server on every request.
3. **Form Schema Caching:** Caches compiled XForm XML definitions and AST-parsed trees to optimize dynamic rendering speeds.

## 3. Database Schematics & Graph Immutability

### 3.1 Database Schematics: Relational (PostgreSQL) DDL
The transactional EDC database is structured to support relational integrity with an immutable audit layer. Below is the strict DDL mapping of the core PostgreSQL tables, including the shadow schema tables and the database triggers that capture out-of-band updates.

```sql
-- Create GxP Schema and compliance audit structures
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS clinical;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS shadow_audit;

-- ENUM definitions for lifecycle control
CREATE TYPE clinical.subject_status AS ENUM (
    'SCREENING', 'SCREEN_FAILED', 'ENROLLED', 'RANDOMIZED', 'ACTIVE', 'COMPLETED', 'WITHDRAWN'
);

CREATE TYPE clinical.query_status AS ENUM (
    'OPEN', 'ANSWERED', 'CLOSED', 'REOPENED'
);

-- Core Subjects Table
CREATE TABLE clinical.subjects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    site_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    subject_identifier VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    status clinical.subject_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'SCREENING',
    enrollment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    demographics_json JSONB NOT NULL,

    -- Universal Audit Inheritance Fields
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reason_for_change TEXT NOT NULL,
    version_index INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

-- eCRF Instance Submissions Table
CREATE TABLE clinical.ecrf_instances (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clinical.subjects(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    form_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    study_version VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    payload_json JSONB NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DRAFT', -- 'DRAFT', 'SUBMITTED', 'VERIFIED'

    -- Universal Audit Inheritance Fields
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reason_for_change TEXT NOT NULL,
    version_index INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

-- Clinical Queries Table
CREATE TABLE clinical.queries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clinical.subjects(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    ecrf_instance_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clinical.ecrf_instances(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    field_xpath TEXT NOT NULL,
    status clinical.query_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'OPEN',
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    history JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,

    -- Universal Audit Inheritance Fields
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reason_for_change TEXT NOT NULL,
    version_index INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

-- Immutable Ledger Shadow Table
CREATE TABLE shadow_audit.ledger_log (
    log_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    operation VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
    record_id UUID NOT NULL,
    pre_state JSONB,
    post_state JSONB,
    hash_chain BYTEA, -- Cryptographic ledger hashing (SHA-256)

    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_by VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reason_for_change TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Index optimization for JSONB query lookups and audit histories
CREATE INDEX idx_subjects_demographics ON clinical.subjects USING gin (demographics_json);
CREATE INDEX idx_ecrf_payload ON clinical.ecrf_instances USING gin (payload_json);
CREATE INDEX idx_queries_xpath ON clinical.queries(field_xpath);
CREATE INDEX idx_ledger_table_record ON shadow_audit.ledger_log(table_name, record_id);
```

### 3.2 Database Triggers for Direct Schema Tampering Protection
To guarantee the requirements of 21 CFR § 11.10(e), an immutable audit trigger is established. It intercepts any updates or deletions at the database level and forces shadow recording, bypassing the application layer if needed.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION shadow_audit.audit_trigger_handler()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    v_pre_state JSONB := NULL;
    v_post_state JSONB := NULL;
    v_username VARCHAR(100);
    v_reason TEXT;
    v_prev_hash BYTEA;
    v_current_hash BYTEA;
BEGIN
    -- Resolve executing user and reason from context session variables (set by execution engine)
    BEGIN
        v_username := COALESCE(current_setting('clinical.session_user', true), 'DB_ADMIN_DIRECT');
        v_reason := COALESCE(current_setting('clinical.session_reason', true), 'DIRECT DB OPERATION BYPASSING APP LAYER');
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        v_username := 'DB_ADMIN_SYSTEM';
        v_reason := 'SYSTEM ENGINE EMERGENCY SCRIPT EXECUTION';
    END;

    -- Map pre and post states
    IF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
        v_pre_state := to_jsonb(OLD);
        v_post_state := to_jsonb(NEW);
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        v_pre_state := to_jsonb(OLD);
        -- Strictly block hard delete of patient records in GxP context
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'DIRECT HARD DELETE OF GXP CLINICAL RECORDS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED (Table: %). USE SOFT-DELETE CONSTRAINTS.', TG_TABLE_NAME;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        v_post_state := to_jsonb(NEW);
    END IF;

    -- Fetch latest hash chain from shadow audit ledger to preserve cryptographically chained security
    SELECT hash_chain INTO v_prev_hash
    FROM shadow_audit.ledger_log
    ORDER BY log_id DESC LIMIT 1;

    IF v_prev_hash IS NULL THEN
        v_prev_hash := decode('e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855', 'hex'); -- SHA-256 of empty string
    END IF;

    -- Compute next hash: SHA-256(prev_hash || table_name || op || post_state)
    v_current_hash := digest(v_prev_hash || TG_TABLE_NAME::bytea || TG_OP::bytea || COALESCE(v_post_state::text, '')::bytea, 'sha256');

    -- Insert into immutable shadow audit ledger
    INSERT INTO shadow_audit.ledger_log (
        table_name, operation, record_id, pre_state, post_state, hash_chain, created_by, reason_for_change
    ) VALUES (
        TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, COALESCE(NEW.id, OLD.id), v_pre_state, v_post_state, v_current_hash, v_username, v_reason
    );

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Attach triggers to database tables
CREATE TRIGGER audit_subjects_trigger
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON clinical.subjects
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION shadow_audit.audit_trigger_handler();

CREATE TRIGGER audit_ecrf_trigger
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON clinical.ecrf_instances
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION shadow_audit.audit_trigger_handler();

CREATE TRIGGER audit_queries_trigger

    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION shadow_audit.audit_trigger_handler();
```

### 3.3 Neo4j Graph Schema & Versioning Blueprint
The Designer Service manages clinical structures in a Neo4j graph. Below is the structural representation of the node configurations and how branching versioning is maintained without duplicate node corruption.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Study {
        +UUID id
        +String name
        +String registration_id
    }
    class StudyVersion {
        +UUID id
        +String version_tag
        +String status
        +Int version_index
        +DateTime created_at
        +String created_by
    }
    class StudyArm {
        +UUID id
        +String name
        +String arm_type
    }
    class Epoch {
        +UUID id
        +String name
        +Int sequence_order
    }
    class Visit {
        +UUID id
        +String name
        +Int visit_window_days
    }
    class Form {
        +UUID id
        +String form_key
        +String xform_definition_xml
    }
    class BiomedicalConcept {
        +UUID id
        +String concept_code
        +String concept_name
        +JSON vlm_rules
    }

    Study "1" --> "1..*" StudyVersion : HAS_VERSION
    StudyVersion "1" --> "0..1" StudyVersion : PREVIOUS_VERSION
    StudyVersion "1" --> "1..*" StudyArm : HAS_ARM
    StudyVersion "1" --> "1..*" Epoch : HAS_EPOCH
    Epoch "1" --> "1..*" Visit : HAS_VISIT
    Visit "1" --> "1..*" Form : HAS_FORM
    Form "1" --> "1..*" BiomedicalConcept : MEASURES
```

### 3.4 Graph Immutability Enforcement & Branching Protocol
To preserve strict scientific reproducibility, study graphs become **permanently frozen** once published (`LOCKED` status).

#### 3.4.1 Immutability Enforcement
The Designer Service executes an assertion check on every mutating transaction.
```python
async def assert_graph_mutable(tx: Transaction, study_version_id: str):
    query = """
    MATCH (sv:StudyVersion {id: $id})
    RETURN sv.status AS status
    """
    result = await tx.run(query, id=study_version_id)
    record = await result.single()
    if record and record["status"] in ["LOCKED", "PUBLISHED", "ARCHIVED"]:
        raise PermissionError(
            f"Graph Mutation Prohibited: StudyVersion {study_version_id} has status {record['status']} and is frozen."
        )
```

#### 3.4.2 Branching Protocol (Protocol Amendments)
When an investigator initiates a protocol amendment, the system executes a deep copy branching transaction.
1. Create a new `StudyVersion` node with `version_index = previous.version_index + 1`.
2. Generate semantic versioning tag (e.g., `1.0.0` $\rightarrow$ `1.1.0` for clinical amendments; `1.0.0` $\rightarrow$ `2.0.0` for design restructuring).
3. Clone all structural child nodes linked to the target graph path.
4. Relate the new `StudyVersion` to the original via a `PREVIOUS_VERSION` relationship.
5. All clinical transactions (EDC) executed after the publication timestamp route metadata mapping calls to the new branched ID.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SV_V1[StudyVersion v1.0.0 - Status: LOCKED]
    SV_V2[StudyVersion v1.1.0 - Status: ACTIVE]

    SV_V2 -->|PREVIOUS_VERSION| SV_V1

    subgraph v1 Graph Path
        SV_V1 --> Arm_V1[StudyArm: Standard Care]
        Arm_V1 --> Visit_V1[Visit: Day 0]
    end

    subgraph v2 Graph Path (Cloned & Branched)
        SV_V2 --> Arm_V2[StudyArm: Standard Care]
        Arm_V2 --> Visit_V2[Visit: Day 0]
        SV_V2 --> Arm_Exp[StudyArm: Experimental Combo]
    end
```

### 3.5 Graph Tree-Diffing & Reconciliation Algorithm
When promoting a protocol amendment, the system needs to compute structural modifications between the old version $G_{old}$ and the branched version $G_{new}$. The tree-diffing algorithm traverses the hierarchical study structure and generates an execution instruction set.

```python
def compute_graph_diff(tx, old_version_id: str, new_version_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Traverses study tree levels: StudyVersion -> Epoch -> Visit -> Form -> BiomedicalConcept.
    Identifies additions, modifications, and deletions.
    """
    diff_results = {"added_nodes": [], "modified_nodes": [], "deleted_nodes": []}

    # Retrieve structured maps for old and new subgraphs
    old_nodes = tx.run(
        "MATCH (sv:StudyVersion {id: $id})-[:HAS_EPOCH]->(e)-[:HAS_VISIT]->(v)-[:HAS_FORM]->(f) "
        "RETURN e.id, v.id, f.id, f.form_key, f.xform_definition_xml",
        id=old_version_id,
    ).data()

    new_nodes = tx.run(
        "MATCH (sv:StudyVersion {id: $id})-[:HAS_EPOCH]->(e)-[:HAS_VISIT]->(v)-[:HAS_FORM]->(f) "
        "RETURN e.id, v.id, f.id, f.form_key, f.xform_definition_xml",
        id=new_version_id,
    ).data()

    old_map = {n["f.form_key"]: n for n in old_nodes}
    new_map = {n["f.form_key"]: n for n in new_nodes}

    # Check for additions and modifications
    for form_key, node in new_map.items():
        if form_key not in old_map:
            diff_results["added_nodes"].append(
                {"type": "Form", "key": form_key, "payload": node}
            )
        else:
            # Check if properties have changed
            if (
                node["f.xform_definition_xml"]
                != old_map[form_key]["f.xform_definition_xml"]
            ):
                diff_results["modified_nodes"].append(
                    {
                        "type": "Form",
                        "key": form_key,
                        "old_value": old_map[form_key]["f.xform_definition_xml"],
                        "new_value": node["f.xform_definition_xml"],
                    }
                )

    # Check for deletions
    for form_key, node in old_map.items():
        if form_key not in new_map:
            diff_results["deleted_nodes"].append({"type": "Form", "key": form_key})

    return diff_results
```

## 4. XForm Rendering & Engine Rules (The Execution Engine)

### 4.1 Custom XForm AST Engine Specification
The Cadence Execution Engine uses a highly optimized, custom-built Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) evaluator specifically designed to execute dynamic binding expressions, check dynamic conditions, and evaluate complex XPath paths on the client's device.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

### 4.2 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Parser Node Structure
Below is the structural definition of an AST parser node implemented in the execution client runtime (Python/TypeScript).

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union


class ASTNode:
    def __init__(self, node_type: str, value: Any = None):
        self.node_type = node_type  # 'LITERAL', 'XPATH', 'OPERATOR', 'FUNCTION'

            return context_data.get(resolved_path, None)

        elif self.node_type == "OPERATOR":
            left = self.children[0].evaluate(context_data, current_indices)
            right = self.children[1].evaluate(context_data, current_indices)

            if left is None or right is None:
                return False

            if self.value == "==":
                return left == right

            if self.value == ">":
                return float(left) > float(right)
            if self.value == "<":
                return float(left) < float(right)

        elif self.node_type == "FUNCTION":

            if self.value == "indexed-repeat":
                return self.evaluate_indexed_repeat(context_data, current_indices)

        return None

    def resolve_relative_path(self, path: str, current_indices: Dict[str, int]) -> str:
        """

        if path.startswith("../"):
            # Replace relative context backtrace using current active nodes

        return path

    def evaluate_indexed_repeat(

        repeat_group = self.children[1].value
        target_index = int(self.children[2].evaluate(context_data, current_indices))

        indexed_path = f"{repeat_group}[{target_index}]/{target_path.split('/')[-1]}"
        return context_data.get(indexed_path, None)
```

### 4.3 Bind Node Property Resolution: `relevant`, `readonly`, `required`
Dynamic rendering behavior depends on property binding states checked on every mutation.

| Property | AST Evaluation Trigger | Engine Enforcement State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`relevant`** | Value change of any path node referenced in dependency tree. | If evaluates to `False`, the engine deletes the target field's captured value from memory to prevent orphaned data. It also transitions UI state to hidden. |
| **`readonly`** | Triggered by user security role validation or study transition state (e.g., Verified). | If `True`, DOM element disables interaction, and API rejects any incoming payloads carrying updates to this node. |
| **`required`** | Evaluated upon transition to 'Completed' status or form section traversal. | If `True` and value is `null`/empty, block progress, generate high-visibility validation highlights, and prevent form sign-off. |

### 4.4 Advanced Memory & Rendering Optimization for Large Forms
For comprehensive trials containing long, detailed forms (such as 500+ fields on dynamic clinical visit sequences), standard web-based engines will encounter out-of-memory errors and input lag.

Cadence solves this by implementing three strict optimization strategies:

#### 4.4.1 Virtualized DOM Rendering Engine
Instead of rendering the entire XForm document structure, the layout engine calculates precise element heights and maintains a fixed-size rendering container.

$$H_{viewport} = \sum_{i=start}^{end} Height(Element_i)$$

Only components within the visible viewport (plus a 3-element pre-buffer) are rendered into the active DOM. All off-screen fields are replaced by static spacer blocks to keep the active DOM count below 100 elements.

#### 4.4.2 State Batching & Execution Debouncing
To prevent XPath evaluation loops from blocking the single UI render thread, input mutations are routed through a debounced state buffer.

```
[User Input Event]
        │
        ▼
[Debounce Queue (50ms)]
        │
        ▼
[Batch Aggregate Inputs]
        │
        ▼
[Single Run AST Evaluator]
        │
        ▼
[Dynamic DOM Update]
```

This prevents recalculation of the expression tree on every keystroke, reducing CPU cycles from $O(N)$ (where $N$ is the number of dynamic fields) to an aggregated flat cost.

#### 4.4.3 Lexical Parsing Caching & AST Re-use
The evaluation service compiles all raw XForm expression paths into parsed AST structures upon form initialize.

The compiled trees are kept in an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with an absolute size of 200 trees. The runtime completely avoids recompiling expression tokens during live data entry sessions.

## 5. Data Synchronization & Offline Engine

### 5.1 System Architecture for Disconnected Environments
To support remote site centers with spotty connectivity, the Cadence EDC utilizes a robust offline synchronization engine built on a background service worker running an IndexedDB queue.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    user_sub[User Clicks Submit Form] --> connection_check{Network Connected?}

    connection_check -->|Yes| online_post[REST Sync Payload POST to /api/edc/submit]
    connection_check -->|No| offline_store[Store in IndexedDB 'pending_sync_queue']

    offline_store --> register_worker[Register background-sync task with browser]

    subgraph Service Worker - Sync Process
        register_worker --> background_poll{Network restored?}
        background_poll -->|No| wait_state[Wait for sync wake-up event]
        background_poll -->|Yes| pull_payload[Retrieve batch payload from IndexedDB]
        pull_payload --> push_server[Brotli compressed POST submission to endpoint]
    end

    push_server --> sync_done[Clear payload from IndexedDB]
```

### 5.2 Conflict Resolution Algorithm (Last-Write-Wins with Atomic Merging)
In a collaborative clinical environment, multiple site users (monitors, investigators, coordinators) may concurrently edit subject records while offline.

Cadence EDC utilizes a deterministic field-level timestamp-based merging algorithm to reconcile concurrent transactions cleanly.

```python
import datetime
from typing import Dict, Any


def resolve_sync_conflict(
    server_state: Dict[str, Any], client_payload: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Implements a strict, field-level Last-Write-Wins (LWW) conflict resolution logic.
    Supports atomic property merges.
    """
    merged_payload = server_state.copy()

    # Payload format:
    # {
    #   "data": {"age": 42, "weight": 70},
    #   "metadata": {
    #       "timestamps": {"age": "2026-07-22T20:00:00Z", "weight": "2026-07-22T20:10:00Z"},
    #       "modified_by": {"age": "user_1", "weight": "user_2"}
    #   }
    # }

    client_data = client_payload.get("data", {})
    client_meta = client_payload.get("metadata", {})
    client_timestamps = client_meta.get("timestamps", {})

    server_data = server_state.get("data", {})
    server_meta = server_state.get("metadata", {})
    server_timestamps = server_meta.get("timestamps", {})

    for field, client_val in client_data.items():
        client_time_str = client_timestamps.get(field)
        server_time_str = server_timestamps.get(field)

        if not server_time_str:
            # Field doesn't exist on server, merge instantly
            merged_payload["data"][field] = client_val
            merged_payload["metadata"]["timestamps"][field] = client_time_str
            merged_payload["metadata"]["modified_by"][field] = client_meta.get(
                "modified_by", {}
            ).get(field)
            continue

        client_ts = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(
            client_time_str.replace("Z", "+00:00")
        )
        server_ts = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(
            server_time_str.replace("Z", "+00:00")
        )

        if client_ts > server_ts:
            # Client write is newer, update field
            merged_payload["data"][field] = client_val
            merged_payload["metadata"]["timestamps"][field] = client_time_str
            merged_payload["metadata"]["modified_by"][field] = client_meta.get(
                "modified_by", {}
            ).get(field)

        elif client_ts == server_ts:
            # Timestamps are identical, resolve by deterministic sorting of user identifier string
            client_user = client_meta.get("modified_by", {}).get(field, "")
            server_user = server_meta.get("modified_by", {}).get(field, "")

            if client_user > server_user:
                merged_payload["data"][field] = client_val
                merged_payload["metadata"]["timestamps"][field] = client_time_str
                merged_payload["metadata"]["modified_by"][field] = client_user

    return merged_payload
```

#### 5.2.1 Structural Conflicts & Clinical Query Generation
If a structural conflict is detected—such as user A deleting a row in a repeating adverse event grid while user B modifies a field inside that deleted row:
1. The engine rejects the direct update.
2. It persists the current state to a temporary review shadow table.
3. It automatically generates a clinical query with status `OPEN` on the target `field_xpath`:
   - *Message:* "Sync Conflict: Attempted edit to an adverse event record that was deleted by coordinator 'user_A'. Verify details."
   - *Audit Context:* The engine assigns `reason_for_change` to "SYSTEM SYNC EXCEPTION TRIGGERED".

### 5.3 Payload Compression (Brotli vs Gzip Optimization)
Large forms containing extensive arrays, audit trail chains, and embedded telemetry parameters require network optimization.

Cadence enforces dynamic **Brotli** compression for all sync transactions.

| Benchmark Parameter | Gzip (Level 6) | Brotli (Level 11) | Architectural Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compression Ratio (JSON)** | 4.8:1 | **7.4:1** | Brotli achieves 35% smaller packets. |
| **Decompression CPU Cost** | 0.8 ms | 0.9 ms | Negligible difference for client devices. |
| **Network Transfer Speed (5G)** | 120 ms | 78 ms | Brotli provides 35% reduction in sync latency. |

#### Brotli Dynamic Integration Rule
The Gateway Service detects client compression capabilities via the standard `Accept-Encoding: br` header. If present, the service automatically compresses the JSON string output and appends the `Content-Encoding: br` response header.

## 6. ISO 14971 Risk Controls & Architectural Hazard Analysis

In compliance with ISO 14971:2019, this section identifies critical software hazards, analyzes their downstream impact, and links them directly to the architectural safety controls implemented in Cadence Clinical.

| Hazard ID | Software Hazard Category | Trigger Event / Vector | Downstream GxP/Clinical Impact | Class (IEC 62304) | Architectural Mitigation & Safety Control | Verification Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HAZ-001** | **Data Loss** | Sudden container crash or hardware node failure during form write. | Partial write corrupts transactional records; lost patient records. | Class C | PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) replicated synchronously. Local IndexedDB saves draft payloads client-side before network transfer. | Run container killing tests during simulated database write cycles. |
| **HAZ-002** | **Tampering** | Direct administration access or direct SQL execution. | Bypassing audit trail validation on clinical records. | Class C | PostgreSQL Immutable Database Trigger: automatically copies any write delta to the isolated `shadow_audit` schema. | Execute raw update query via direct DB runner; verify write to shadow table is captured. |
| **HAZ-003** | **Blinding Breach** | API boundary failure exposing randomization allocation vectors. | Unblinding of clinical monitors, introducing bias and destroying study validity. | Class C | Physical/logical separation of treatment allocation tables. Dynamic API masking filters randomized variables from sponsor-role requests. | Role-based authorization tests; attempt payload fetch using coordinator role token. |
| **HAZ-004** | **Sync Overwrite** | Concurrent offline edits overwriting clinical inputs. | Silent deletion of vital safety markers or incorrect lab results. | Class C | Field-Level Last-Write-Wins (LWW) conflict algorithm. Automatic Query raises on structural deletions. | Simulate concurrent offline edits with varying timestamps; check output state. |
| **HAZ-005** | **Out-of-Memory** | Complex dynamic eCRFs (500+ fields) crashing target browsers. | Interruption of clinical operations; clinical coordinator unable to enter data. | Class B | Layout Engine Virtualization (releasing hidden components) and State Batching (debouncing thread execution). | Load test using 1000 field forms; monitor memory consumption curve. |
| **HAZ-006** | **Graph Inconsistency** | Out-of-order schema edits in active multi-site studies. | Active clinical visits mapped to incorrect validation rules. | Class C | Graph Immutability Protocol: StudyVersions are permanently frozen upon lock. Amendments spawn isolated branches. | Attempt direct Cypher mutation query against `LOCKED` StudyVersion. Verify error. |

## 7. Change Management, GxP Validation & Operations

### 7.1 GxP Environment Promotion Protocol
In accordance with GxP regulatory requirements, system code and clinical protocol schemas progress through a strictly isolated environment promotion pipeline.

```
[Development (Dev)] ──► [Staging (QA)] ──► [Validation (UAT)] ──► [Production (Prod)]
```

* **Staging (QA):** Handles automated validation runs and performance testing.
* **Validation (UAT):** Enforces 100% test coverage check on all GxP pathways. Manual User Acceptance Testing is performed and signed off.
* **Production (Prod):** Operates on the validated environment. No direct hot-fixes are permitted; every release requires an environment migration script.

### 7.2 Database Migrations & Point-in-Time Recovery
1. **Schema Migrations:** Database migrations are defined using SQL migration files executed sequentially. Each file must define both `UP` and `DOWN` transitions.
2. **Backups & PITR:** PostgreSQL databases utilize continuous archive logging (WAL-G/PgBackRest). This ensures Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) to any target second within a 30-day window, mitigating hardware disasters.
3. **Graph Backups:** Neo4j cluster backups are performed using daily physical dumps, stored in encrypted multi-region AWS S3 buckets.
